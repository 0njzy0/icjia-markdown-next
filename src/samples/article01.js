## Reducing Substance Use Disorders and Related Offending: A Continuum of Evidence-Informed Practices in the Criminal Justice System

In the United States, more than 20 million individuals have substance use disorders (SUDs)—not including individuals with more mild or moderate substance use and misuse.[^1]  Of those with SUDs, just over 10 percent ultimately receive treatment.[^2]  On average, costs incurred in the United States from alcohol and drug use due to lost work productivity, health care expenses, motor vehicle accidents, and criminal justice costs exceeds $400 billion. Almost half of the cost is at the taxpayers’ expense.[^3]


Of the 20 million individuals with SUDs, a subset is involved with the criminal justice system. More than half of the 2.2 million individuals housed in U.S. prisons and jails meet the clinical diagnosis criteria for SUDs.[^4]  Seventy-eight percent of violent crimes and 77 percent of property crimes involve drugs and/or alcohol.[^5]  The government spends an estimated $74 billion dollars on court processing, community supervision, and imprisonment of individuals with SUDs, but just 1 percent of that amount on prevention and treatment for these individuals.[^6]  In addition, about 11 percent of prisoners with SUDs or substance misuse receive treatment.
